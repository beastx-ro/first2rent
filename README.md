- Create a "Preferences" sheet for search criteria

2. **Search Phase** (run daily/weekly):

## Quick Commands:
- "Setup apartment hunt" - Creates spreadsheet
- "Search apartments" - Runs full search
- "What's new?" - Shows only new/changed listings
- "Research [address]" - Deep dive on specific listing

## Key Rules:
- Never duplicate listings (match by address+price)
- Always note price changes
- Flag suspicious listings (too cheap, stock photos)
- Keep status updated (New→Contacted→Viewing→Applied)

When searching, be patient with slow sites and handle pagination properly (stop going to the next page of a single search after the 3rd page). Adapt to layout changes by finding elements by their context rather than exact selectors.
